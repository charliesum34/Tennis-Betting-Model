This is an effort at creating a predictive tennis betting model in Rstudio. The inspiration for this lies here: https://betfair-datascientists.github.io/modelling/soccerEloTutorialR/ where a similar idea is applied for predictive outcomes of football matches.
All necessary data can be found at http://www.tennis-data.co.uk/.
The premise of this work is to calculate 'power' ratings for individual male tennis players. Using long term results of a tennis players career we can attempt to describe their overall ability of winning matches by a single number; their ELO rating. Yes, ELO... the one from Chess. Every player starts off at a 1500 rating, wins are rewarded and losses not. How much your rating improves depends on the difficulty of opponent and margin of victory (number of games) in a match. 
As of 12th August 2024, the current male rankings (according to my ELO score) look something like this: image here
This would forecast the following win probabilities if some of those players were to match up tomorrow: image here


üéæ Predictive Tennis Betting Model in RStudio
This project is an effort to create a predictive tennis betting model using RStudio. Inspired by the soccer ELO tutorial, this model applies similar concepts to predict outcomes of tennis matches.

üîç Overview
The main goal of this project is to calculate 'power' ratings for individual male tennis players, which can then be used to predict match outcomes. The core of the model is based on the ELO rating system, originally developed for Chess.

Data Source
All necessary data is sourced from Tennis Data, which provides historical match results crucial for calculating accurate player ratings.

How It Works
Initial Ratings: Every player starts with a rating of 1500.
Wins and Losses: Ratings are adjusted based on match results. Wins increase a player's rating, while losses decrease it.
Opponent Difficulty: The rating adjustment depends on the strength of the opponent.
Margin of Victory: The number of games won in a match also affects the rating adjustment.
üìä Current ELO Rankings
As of 12th August 2024, the current male tennis rankings according to the ELO score are:
